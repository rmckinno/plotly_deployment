# Belly Button Diversity Dashboard
Using JavaScript and Plotly to build a dashboard with different charts to visualize data

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage using JavaScript and D3 library to deploy a dashboard using information from participants in a study to identify bacteria in each participant's navel. The panel allows volunteers to select their ID number to display demographic information and the bacterial species found in their belly buttons. The top 10 bacterial results, the number of navel washes per week, and the number of cultures per sample are visualized using Plotly.
